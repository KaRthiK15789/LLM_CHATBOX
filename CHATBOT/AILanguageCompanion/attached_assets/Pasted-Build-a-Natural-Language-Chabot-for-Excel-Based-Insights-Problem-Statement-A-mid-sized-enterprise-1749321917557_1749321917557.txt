Build a Natural Language Chabot for Excel-Based
Insights
Problem Statement
A mid-sized enterprise relies heavily on Excel reports to track all its business operaƟons,
including sales, inventory, employee performance and financial KPIs. OŌen, business users
need quick insights from these files without waiƟng on the technical and reporƟng teams to
filter, aggregate or visualize the data effecƟvely.
As an intern at NeoStats, you are tasked with designing a conversaƟonal assistant that can read
and understand Excel files and help users get the answers they need simply by asking quesƟons
in plain English.
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to work with structured data, integrate
LLMs, reason through queries and build an intuiƟve user facing applicaƟon.

Your ObjecƟve
You will build a web-based chat assistant that:
 Accepts an Excel file from the user
 Reads and analyses the data
 Allows users to ask natural language quesƟons
 Returns answers as texts, tables or charts depending on the query.
Data AssumpƟons
The assistant should be able to handle general tabular data uploaded as an Excel file. Please
keep the following expectaƟons in mind:
1. Excel File Format
 Input will be a standard .xlsx file.
 The file will contain one sheet with a clearly labelled header row and
structured data.
 Expect up to 500 rows and 10-20 columns.
2. Data Types
 The dataset will contain a mix of numeric columns, categorical columns and
binary indicators (yes/no flags).
 Some columns may contain missing or null values.
 Columns names may include spaces, special character, or inconsistent casing.
3. Assistant Behaviour
 AutomaƟcally infer and understand column types
 Normalize column names internally for processing
 Avoid relying on hardcoded column names or schemas.

4. Types of QuesƟons to Support
The assistant should support natural language queries like:
 StaƟsƟcally summaries (e.g. What is the average income?)
 Filtered queries (e.g. How many customers are under 30?)
 Comparisons or groupings (e.g. Compare loan defaults by gender)
 Visual insights (e.g. Show a bar chart of transacƟon count by job)
5. VisualizaƟons
If the quesƟon implies a trend, comparison, or distribuƟon, generate appropriate
charts (e.g. bar chart, histograms, line chart). Ensure the charts are readable and
labelled clearly.
6. Important Notes
 Do not hardcode any column names, values or assumpƟons.
 Focus on making your assistant flexible and schema agnosƟc.
 Treat this as a general-purpose insight engine. Your goal is to make the
assistant useful even if the Excel schema changes.
 You may leverage the open-source LLMs or OpenAI as needed; however,
please note that NeoStats will not be providing any APIs for this use case.

Submission Guidelines
1. Host your applicaƟon Your conversaƟonal assistant should be available for us to test
through a live hosted link.
Suggested plaƞorms:
 Streamlit Cloud
 Hugging Face Spaces
2. Submit a GitHub Repository Link Share a link to your public GitHub repository
containing:
 All project source code.
 A clear and concise README.md
3. Please ensure to include a PPT document that describes your soluƟon.

EvaluaƟon Criteria:
 FuncƟonal correctness: The assistant correctly reads Excel files, processes data and
answers quesƟons accurately.
 Reasoning and use of LLM: EffecƟve integraƟon of the language model to understand
queries and extract insights.
 Chart generaƟon and visualizaƟon: Appropriate and clear charts are generated when
quesƟons require visual data representaƟon.

Usability and interface design: The app is easy to use, intuiƟve, and provides clear
feedback or error messages.
 Code quality and organizaƟon: Code is clean, modular, well-documented, and easy to
maintain.
 Flexibility and generalizaƟon: The assistant works well across different Excel schemas
without hardcoded assumpƟons.
 CreaƟvity and bonus features (opƟonal): AddiƟonal useful features, thoughƞul
design improvements, or enhanced UX/UI elements.

Remember, this project is an opportunity to showcase your skills, creaƟvity, and problem-
solving abiliƟes. Candidates are expected to showcase their analyƟcal, logical thinking, and

deducƟon skills throughout this challenge. Your approach to the problem, as well as your
ability to present and defend your findings, will be central to the evaluaƟon process.
Please ensure the work is your original work. Any kind of plagiarism or taking help from others
will have adverse consequences. Refrain from using ChatGPT, Gemini or any other AI tool, this
will lead to immediate disqualificaƟon. We strictly do not tolerate any kind of malpracƟce or
misbehaviour.
